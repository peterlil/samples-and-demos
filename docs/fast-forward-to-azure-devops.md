# Fast Forward to Azure DevOps
The point with this session is to demonstrate how easy it can be to start from scratch with a project and add source control versioning, continouos integration and continouos delivery to Azure Web Apps. To start simple, fast with low environment friction, is important for the creative process and to be able to show and lobby for the ideas your and/or your team has. Being able to do so, but at the same time, creating a foundation from which you can continue to grow and more advanced stuff to as you actually need it, is also of course very important. There's not much to gain if you need to start over just becuase you need to scale your team as the idea turns in to an formal project.

## Coding the idea

Start new with a simple webapp (AspNet Core 3.1/Linux) in Visual Studio
Create and test the webapp locally


Create a DevOps project
Add source to project

Create Azure WebApp (Free Plan)
Create deployment pipeline through Deployment Center

Show the deployed app
Show the CI/CD pipeline that got created

Make updates to the app
Show changes in GUI
